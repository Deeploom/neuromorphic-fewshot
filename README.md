# Evaluating Few-Shot Learning Performance on Noisy Neuromorphic Data using Prototypical Networks

## Overview

This project aims to evaluate the performance of few-shot learning (FSL) techniques, particularly Prototypical Networks (ProtoNets), on noisy neuromorphic data. Neuromorphic systems attempt to emulate the behavior of biological neural networks, but noise in the data can affect the performance of machine learning models. Few-shot learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on learning from a small number of examples, which is particularly useful when working with limited or noisy datasets.

In this project, we explore how Prototypical Networks, a model-based approach to few-shot learning, performs when applied to neuromorphic data that contains inherent noise. The goal is to understand how noise impacts the learning process and to assess the effectiveness of few-shot learning strategies in such scenarios.

## Key Features

- Evaluation of Prototypical Networks on noisy neuromorphic datasets.
- Few-shot learning framework for handling limited data.
- Analysis of model performance in the presence of noise.
- Codebase designed for ease of experimentation with different datasets and network configurations.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary libraries including those for deep learning, data manipulation, and other utilities.

## Usage

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the training, evaluation, or testing scripts for the project.

### Running Training:

To train the Prototypical Networks on your neuromorphic dataset, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config <config-file>
```

This will start the training process based on the specified configuration in the config file.

### Running Evaluation:

To evaluate a trained model on the test set, use:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model <path-to-model> --test-set <path-to-test-data>
```

This will evaluate the model's performance on the noisy test set.

### Notebooks:

There are several Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory that provide detailed analyses of the model, dataset, and experiments. You can run the notebooks with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Dataset

This project uses neuromorphic data generated from [specify the data source or simulated environment]. The dataset consists of noisy sensory data collected from neuromorphic hardware or simulated neural networks. Data pre-processing and augmentation strategies are crucial in ensuring meaningful results in few-shot learning tasks.

### Dataset Files

- `train_data/`: Training data used to train the model.
- `test_data/`: Test data used to evaluate the model.
- `labels/`: Ground truth labels for the dataset.

## Training and Evaluation

Training a Prototypical Network model on noisy neuromorphic data involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle noise and prepare it for training.
2. **Model Training**: Train the Prototypical Network model using the training data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to determine how well it handles few-shot learning on noisy data.

### Training Configuration

You can configure the training process through a config file (`config.yaml`). This file contains the following parameters:

- `learning_rate`: The learning rate for the optimizer.
- `batch_size`: Number of samples per batch during training.
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `noise_level`: The level of noise in the data, which can be adjusted to simulate different scenarios.

### Example Command for Training:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

## Results

In this section, we present the results of the model's performance across different experiments, including various noise levels and few-shot learning tasks. We evaluate the model based on accuracy, model robustness to noise, and its ability to generalize from a limited number of examples.

### Example Results:

| Noise Level | Accuracy (%) |
|-------------|--------------|
| Low         | 90           |
| Medium      | 80           |
| High        | 70           |
